                            <p>Whether you're working with APIs as the backend to your mobile site or publishing them for others to consume, this session will show you how to write really excellent and useful services. We’ll cover selecting the right service type to use and how to design a flexible, maintainable system with an outward-facing API that will have your users easily utilising its features. There will be tips and tricks on helping minimise user confusion (and resulting bug reports) and how to achieve robust services and happy users who cite your application as their "must-have". Recommended for developers and architects from all technology backgrounds.</p>

                            <p>It has been possible to instantly push information from a web server to a web browser for at least 10 years, but this technology has finally gone mainstream thanks to technologies like WebSockets and solutions like SignalR, socket.io, Faye and Pusher. In this sessions I'll cover the past, present and future of client/server communication technology, the realtime web and provide a number of use cases and demonstrations of how the technology is actually used today (it's not just chat and spaceship games).</p>

                            <p>The year 2013. The web has exploded. Fridges, bus stops and light bulbs are all connected to the web. Small networked quadcopters are flying around the globe dancing to dubstep. Even your mum has a super powerful smartphone in her pocket. In this introductory talk learn what this means for programming and how you can use your JavaScript superpowers to create modern, networked applications with Node.js.</p>

                            <p>Go is a young language that's gotten a lot of press. In this talk, Peter will give a brief overview of the language, describe how and at what scale SoundCloud uses Go in production, and then get right to work building an interesting application or two. Hopefully it will inspire you to use Go in your hack!</p>

In this, almost-the-end-of-the-day-beer-soon 40 minutes, Martyn will discuss options for making your workflow faster than ever, looking at Yeoman, Grunt, Bower and others as well as when to go DRY and write your own using languages you know and love.</p>

                            <p>It has never been easier to package your web apps in one way or another but why would we need to. Companies like Google, Mozilla and Adobe provide us ways to wrap HTML, JS and CSS as browser extensions or full on mobile/desktop apps. Cristiano highlights the divergence of technologies being used and looks into the future convergence of the web standards that power these apps. All of this to answer one essential question: is there a one-size-fits-all solution?</p>
